**The Office** - Remote/Hybrid/On-Site Work

Four years ago, almost to the day we were hit with a worldwide pandemic that sent all of us to lockdown,  some of us ,for the first time, to work from home. 
Remote workers are percieved more productive because they have no commute, fewer distractions, more time for family, exercise, and overall better work-life balance. 
But are there also benefits for Working from the business premesis? The office? 

The dataset I analysed included a questionnaire answered by 65thousand employees who work on some scale between fully remote to fully on site. Among basic details such as gender,age, education and income, they also rated what are the benefits of WFH(working from home) and WBP(working on business premises), and what is their top 3 most important benefits.
